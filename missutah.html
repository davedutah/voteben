				<p>Dear Voters:</p>

				<p>My name is Elizabeth Johnson Craig. I believe the selection of the new Utah County Attorney is the most important election in our county this year. In 1991, I had the privilege
					of representing the State of Utah as Miss Utah in the Miss America Scholarship Pageant. Subsequently, I married; had five children; volunteered with the PTA; and went
					to nursing homes nearly every Sunday with my family to provide musical entertainment for the residents. I chaired the Orem Beautification project, and volunteered my time
					for numerous other neighborhood, city, and church related organizations. As my kids got a little older, I began again to develop my career as an author and motivational
					speaker. In 2008 and 2009, I was traveling all over the United States and Canada speaking at colleges, businesses, youth conferences and especially for youth (EFY) events--striving
					to empower youth and adults alike to find their inner strength and be the best person they can be. Some of my talks were recorded and were being sold by Deseret Book.
					I loved the opportunity to help others. I was not wealthy by any means, but my career was blossoming.</p>

				<p>In 2009, I was asked by a friend to help a charity supporting impoverished children throughout the world. He was given “dump product” by a representative from a large Provo
					based company, and delivered what he could directly to those in need, and asked me to sell, on-line, other high-end products that were not practical to aid the plight
					of the impoverished. The profits from the sale of the product were then used to support the charitable activities. Unbeknownst to us, the company representative who donated
					the product to charity rather than delivering it to the dump, may have violated company policy. The company contacted the police. I cooperated completely. I had nothing
					to hide. Nevertheless, I was arrested. My mug shot was splattered all over the local and national media. Jeff Buhman, the Utah County Attorney, and his deputies treated
					me as if I were part of an “organized crime family.” They charged me with Money Laundering, Theft, and Racketeering. As if those charges were not outrageous enough, they
					added a gang enhancement to the charges against this mother of five. I was facing life in prison. As the news quickly spread, I was fired by BYU; dropped by Deseret Book
					(all of my product was pulled); at least 67 scheduled public speaking engagements were canceled and not rescheduled; many of my neighbors, friends, and church leaders
					ostracized me based on the Mafioso picture that Jeff Buhman and his associates painted. I lost nearly everything except the love of my immediate family and some close
					friends.</p>

				<p>I hired an attorney who contacted the Utah County Attorney’s Office to explain the truth. They weren’t interested. The company wanted us prosecuted, and Jeff Buhman and his
					deputies were there to do the company’s bidding. I did not assert my “right to remain silent.” I tried to tell them the truth. The Utah County Attorney’s Office didn’t
					care. After reason failed, a preliminary hearing in the Fourth District Court was finally held. It had been delayed numerous times due to the prosecution being unprepared.
					At the hearing, the Utah County Attorney deputies, with the company’s attorney sitting by their side, called witnesses for two days. Finally, on December 6, 2010, after
					all of the prosecution’s witnesses and arguments were submitted, Judge Darold McDade declared, “there is not one bit of evidence” against me. He dismissed all of my charges.
					I was free to return to my true gang, my family, without the anxiety of another court hearing. Did I feel relief to no longer be facing life in prison? Yes! Could Judge
					McDade order Jeff Buhman to give me my life back? No! The Utah County Attorney’s Office claimed governmental immunity when I attempted to make a claim to recover the $78,000
					in attorney fees I was forced to spend to defend myself. Apparently governmental immunity even prevented Jeff Buhman and his office from offering me an apology.</p>

				<p>It is now more than three years later. Instead of flying all around the country striving to empower and motivate people, I am scrubbing bathrooms and caring for the elderly
					who are beyond the point of judging. Sadly, too many people seem to think if a person is charged with a crime, they are guilty, and if they are acquitted or the charges
					are dismissed, they got off on some technicality. I DID NOTHING WRONG. I AM INNOCENT. Yet, life as I knew it is no more. I remember what I used to do with each swirl of
					the toilet brush. I am grateful to have a job, and have even greater respect for those who work non-glamorous jobs, as I now do, to survive. But, I miss what I used to
					do. I miss the letters from young and old alike telling me how my talks changed their lives for the better. I am doing the best I can. I do not want what happened to me
					to happen to someone else.</p>

				<p>We need change at the Utah County Attorney’s Office. Without change, you or your loved one could be the next one to be violated as I was. I believe that Ben Stanley can restore
					integrity to the Utah County Attorney’s Office. I hope that you will join me and support Ben Stanley to be our next Utah County Attorney.</p>

				<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<p>Elizabeth Johnson Craig</p>
