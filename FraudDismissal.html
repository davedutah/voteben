				<p>We have been making a case that there is room for improvement despite many great people in our Utah County Attorney's Office. We offer summaries of documents we have seen,
					including the source documents for your review where applicable. We have been selecting examples that are noteworthy, have been in the news, and that are all well documented.</p>

				<p>We do not need or intend to re-litigate cases in front of voters: we simply want to highlight concerns about violations of constitutional rights and prosecutorial misconduct
					that my opponent denies but judges have acknowledged. I am often asked what cases are concerning to me: my heart goes out to victims, including both those who are victimized
					by criminals and those who are victimized in our criminal justice system. I believe we can more effectively hold people accountable for both forms of victimization.</p>

				<p>For example, on January 30, 2014, a judge in the Fourth District Court dismissed a criminal case of Securities Fraud because the Utah County Attorney's Office refused to comply
					with the judge's order. &#34;[T]he State has disregarded two separate Orders of this Court to provide a Bill of Particulars containing the requisite information, and this
					period of non-compliance has continued for over four months. This is unacceptable and has unreasonably and unnecessarily delayed this proceeding, to the prejudice of Defendant.&#34;</p>

				<p>A complete and accurate copy of the judge's order can be found <a href="http://voteben.com/media/Paul%20Pratt%20Dismissal%20Order%20for%20Failure%20to%20C.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<p>Though the case has since been filed again, the costs to both sides are significant. I have been a courtroom litigator for many years. One of the first lessons I learned was
					to show respect for the judges and follow their instructions. I want to strengthen the reputation, performance, and service of the Utah County Attorney's Office. With
					your help, we can do so. Cases should not be dismissed because prosecutors disagree with a judge's decision and refuse to comply with a simple order to provide information
					to the defendant. The Utah County Attorney's conduct led to wasted tax payer dollars, unnecessary prejudice to the accused, and delays in justice for victims, should a
					court ultimately find that a crime was committed. I believe that the culture and attitude of an office such as the Utah County Attorney's Office starts from the top and
					filters down. If you give me your vote to be the next Utah County Attorney, I commit to set a standard of excellence and respect that will start with me and be expected
					of each attorney in the office.</p>
