<p class="subheader">Dear Friends, Neighbors, and Voters,</p>



<p class="text">At the urging of great people and influential groups across this county, I entered the race for Utah County Attorney to champion better results, more thoughtful and principled consideration of cases, and a focus on meeting the needs of the public. I ask for your vote for the Republican nomination.</p>

<p class="text">I am a graduate <em>magna cum laude</em> from the BYU Law School, a young father, Eagle Scout, constitutional scholar, and Rotarian. I serve on Pleasant Grove's City Council and in leadership within my religious and secular communities. I am an advocate for law enforcement, and have graduated from my city's citizen police academy. And I am a staunch defender of individual rights and liberties. I am a life-long Republican who provided election law compliance work for both of Mitt Romney's campaigns for the White House. I have supplied policy, legal, and strategy advice for a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate for the most populous state in our nation. In my private law practice I have represented clients around the globe in complex, multi-jurisdictional matters with billions of dollars at stake and defended officers and directors of public companies in governmental investigations with threats of criminal sanctions.</p>

<p class="text">And I am honored to be asked by so many to serve because I believe we can do a better job in Utah County with (1) Accountability, (2) Transparency, (3) Integrity, (4) Capability, and (5) Efficiency. Read about my <a href="background.html" class="mail">background</a> and <a href="position.html" class="mail">positions</a> for more information, and please join our important cause today. Get in touch, let me know how I can serve you best in office, and help us stand up for qualifications, experience, judgment, and a healthier balance between the public and private sectors.</p>

<p class="text">We need your support and your vote to improve the level of legal representation in our County.</p>
<br />
