            A little more personal info...
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            I am a staunch defender of individual rights and liberties and a constitutional scholar. I'm an advocate for law enforcement and graduated from Pleasant Grove City's Police Academy As a Rotarian and an Eagle Scout I have learned the importance of serving
            people and communities. I currently serve on the Pleasant Grove City Council, its library board, and arts commission.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            A grandson of Orem farmers and educators, with a father in the United States Air Force who kept me traveling the world during my youth, I am proud to call Utah County home. I returned to Utah with my wife of thirteen years, Rebekah, to raise our children
            in an inspiring community we have always loved. Rebekah, my talented wife, is a gifted chemist and plays the violin with the Pleasant Grove Orchestra. She is a dedicated mother and can often be found visiting friends and serving tirelessly
            in the community.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Our children are the delight of our lives. We have been blessed with three children, two daughters and one son.
