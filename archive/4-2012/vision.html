<p class="text">Ben Stanley offers visionary leadership and bold initiatives to improve life in Pleasant Grove without passing the burdens on to the residents.  Solutions to challenges we face require innovative thinking and building businesses within the city.  Ben has proposed a number of ideas to explore further with the City Council, and that he will fearlessly advance so long as they can be implemented in pragmatic ways that promise a return on investment for the city, including:</p>



<ol class="text">

<li>Sponsoring entrepreneurial competitions and offering start-up capital or loans to winning proposals committed to creating new businesses and hiring quality employees within the city limits;</li>

<li>Exploring the possibility of a WiMAX wireless network to blanket the city of Pleasant Grove, leading the way throughout the Valley in inexpensive internet access for all residents, while bolstering the city’s attractiveness to global technology companies that have previously brought jobs and campuses to neighboring cities instead of here;</li>

<li>Adopting accountability standards for both city employees and leaders that make local government more of a meritocracy, enabling us to recognize and reward those who consistently meet and exceed expectations while making it harder for failures to translate into massive new burdens on the backs of residents;</li>

<li>Assembling aggressive incentive packages and extending offers to high quality employers and businesses that will hire and expand within Pleasant Grove, bringing the best investment and interest directly to our city;</li>

<li>Bringing in private businesses to analyze city finances and root out waste, excesses, and inefficiencies on a no-risk basis for the city, only receiving compensation as a minor percentage of direct, demonstrable, and immediate savings provided to the city and approved by the Council.</li>

</ol>



<p class="text">These and other specific plans to enhance the reputation, employment levels, savings, and success of Pleasant Grove present an opportunity to reverse the mistakes of the past and overtake neighboring cities that have improved more quickly than Pleasant Grove.  We have a vision of Pleasant Grove leading the Valley, and not following other cities or taking cues from the way things are done in Washington.  We hope you will join us, share your own proposals for Ben to present on behalf of the residents as he serves on the Council, and make your voices heard.</p>
