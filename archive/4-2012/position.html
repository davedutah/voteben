<p class="subheader">Dear Friends and Fellow Residents of Pleasant Grove,</p>



<p class="text">Thank you for the tremendous outpouring of support across all parts of Pleasant Grove during the Primary Election.  We are enthusiastic about the General Election and confident we will have the opportunity to cultivate more business growth opportunities than we have seen in the past, broaden our revenue base, lighten burdens for city residents, reduce the headwinds of heavy debts, protect history and heritage, and see more energetic and experienced councilmembers serve.  Thank you for placing us in an excellent position to be one of those three by the November 8th vote.</p>



<p class="text">My wife and I chose to raise our children in this city we cherish, and while we love the area and admire the men and women who have served the city in the past and continue to do so, we believe it is time for Pleasant Grove to do better.  We can and must do better:</p>



<p class="subheader">1. Financially</p>



<p class="text">By controlling the costs of utilities, reducing waste, reviewing expenses, insisting upon accountability, avoiding excessive debts and the easy, expensive, and enslaving bond offerings that have become so prevalent in modern governments, and being more sophisticated in our negotiations with business partners and neighboring cities.</p>



<p class="subheader">2. Economically</p>



<p class="text">By more aggressively pursuing commercial development and private sector investments in our great city, and being selective and creative in seeking private ventures of the highest quality that generate sufficient revenue for us to avoid debts and overburdening the citizenry, while providing excellent career opportunities to those who desire work within our own city limits.</p>



<p class="subheader">3. Socially</p>



<p class="text">By promoting a commitment to education, celebration of our heritage, respect, and selfless community service: from Strawberry Days, memorials for the uniformed men and women of our town, concerts, and plays, to volunteer events and dedication to preserving and growing opportunities and cultural experiences without straining city budgets or callously pushing unnecessary and unwanted burdens onto the city’s residents.</p>



<p class="text">I pledge to achieve these three goals, spend my time actively engaged in improving the quality of life for everyone in Pleasant Grove, and welcome your support and vote.  Thank you again.</p>
