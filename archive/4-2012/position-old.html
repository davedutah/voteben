<p class="subheader">Dear Friends and Fellow Residents of Pleasant Grove,</p>



<p class="text">Concerned by massive utility rate hikes and staggering new city debts, I entered the race to champion the needs of fiscal conservatives, growing businesses, and struggling families.  My wife and I chose to raise our children in this city we cherish, and while we love the area and admire the men and women who have served the city in the past and continue to do so, we believe it is time for Pleasant Grove to do better.  We can and must do better:</p>



<p class="subheader">1. Financially</p>



<p class="text">By controlling the costs of utilities, reducing waste, reviewing expenses, insisting upon accountability, avoiding excessive debts and the easy, expensive, and enslaving bond offerings that have become so prevalent in modern governments, and being more sophisticated in our negotiations with business partners and neighboring cities.</p>



<p class="subheader">2. Economically</p>



<p class="text">By more aggressively pursuing commercial development and private sector investments in our great city, and being selective and creative in seeking private ventures of the highest quality that generate sufficient revenue for us to avoid debts and overburdening the citizenry, while providing excellent career opportunities to those who desire work within our own city limits.</p>



<p class="subheader">3. Socially</p>



<p class="text">By promoting a commitment to education, celebration of our heritage, respect, and selfless community service: from Strawberry Days, memorials for the uniformed men and women of our town, concerts, and plays, to volunteer events and dedication to preserving and growing opportunities and cultural experiences without straining city budgets or callously pushing unnecessary and unwanted burdens onto the city’s residents.</p>



<p class="text">I pledge to achieve these three goals, spend my time actively engaged in improving the quality of life for everyone in Pleasant Grove, and welcome your support and vote.  Send a clear message of your high expectations to the City Council by voting "Ben Stanley" in the September 13th primary and again in November.</p>
