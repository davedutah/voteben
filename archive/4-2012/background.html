<p class="text">With undergraduate degrees in philosophy, psychology, and logic, Ben went on to graduate <i>magna cum laude</i> and <i>Order of the Coif</i> from the J. Reuben Clark Law School (BYU), where he served on the executive boards of the Law Review and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Society, and developed web-based and computer-automated legal tools used throughout Utah County.  He practiced intellectual property, securities, and corporate governance law, handling billion-dollar litigation for global industry leaders and public companies at the top law firm of Chicago and later California.</p>



<p class="text">He returned to Utah with his beautiful wife of eleven years, Rebekah, to raise their three small children in an inspiring community that they love.  A gifted chemist and dedicated mother, Rebekah has played violin with the Pleasant Grove Orchestra for the past two years and can often be found visiting friends and serving tirelessly in the community.</p>



<p class="text">Ben drafted policy positions, ranging from water rights, prison reform, tort reform, constitutional reform, tax policy, and job creation legislation for a leading candidate for Governor of California during that stateâ€™s 2010 election cycle, and is now turning his attention to the success of Pleasant Grove.  He will not stand idly by while Pleasant Grove falls behind neighboring cities in economic growth and financial management.  He will harness our inventiveness and make the difficult decisions to plan not for political expediency, but for the city that our children and grandchildren will inherit.</p>
