				<h2>Will the Long and Costly MacNeill Trial Verdict Be Overturned?</h2>

				<p><strong>(1)</strong> The Utah County Attorney's Office did not disclose key incentives discussed with an inmate witness, when clearly ordered by the judge to disclose any such
					incentives that had been &#34;promised, expressed, or implied.&#34;</p>

				<p><strong>(2)</strong> The Utah County Attorney's Office failed to instruct their inmate witness to &#34;refrain from watching the trial on television&#34; in a timely manner
					as ordered by the judge.</p>

				<p><strong>(3)</strong> Because of these failings on the part of the prosecution, the guilty verdict in this high-profile murder case may be overturned.</p>

				<p><strong>(4)</strong> If not overturned, these prosecutorial failings may cause the case to be retried, with yet another lengthy and expensive trial.</p>

				<h1>The Complete Story</h1>

				<p>Voters and Friends,</p>

				<p>Thank you for really studying the substance and the issues in this important race. It is my intent for the voices of people to be heard, and for you, the voters, to have
					the opportunity to make well-informed decisions regarding the candidate for the Utah County Attorney who will best be able to balance the interests of being appropriately
					tough on crime, and careful to do all within one's power to avoid charging (or overcharging) the innocent. As you may have seen with <a href="missutah.html">Elizabeth Johnson Craig</a>, improvident
					prosecution can destroy a person's life.</p>

				<p>Many of you likely have heard about the Martin MacNeill case. He was convicted of killing his wife by drugging her and drowning her in the bathtub, and making it appear to
					be an accident. The case was investigated for five and a half years before charges were brought. A year and three months after filing, MacNeill was convicted of murder.
					On its face, it seems to be a real feather in the cap of the Utah County Attorney's Office. My fear is that due to irresponsible conduct by the Utah County Attorney's
					Office, in direct violation of an order of the Judge, the conviction stands a very good chance of being over-turned. <a href="http://www.voteben.com/media/Reply%20Memo%20in%20Support%20of%20Motion%20to%20Arrest%20Judgment.pdf"
					target="_blank">A memorandum</a> was recently filed by Mr. MacNeill's defense attorney. I have been around enough to know that one must consider arguments of an advocate
					carefully before making conclusions. The information expressed in this email is not based on the arguments of MacNeill's attorney, but from a plain reading of the documentary
					evidence. I have attached <a href="http://www.voteben.com/media/Reply%20Memo%20in%20Support%20of%20Motion%20to%20Arrest%20Judgment.pdf" target="_blank">a link to the defense attorney's entire memo</a> for
					you to review, if you wish, to make your own conclusions. I will summarize the most relevant facts as I see them:</p>

				<p>(1) On October 8, 2013, in response to a motion by MacNeill's attorney, Judge Pullan ordered the prosecution to disclose all benefits &#34;promised, expressed, or implied&#34;
					to the inmate witnesses it planned to call to testify against MacNeill.</p>

				<p>(2) On October 15, 2013, a day before the trial began, the prosecution filed the written pleading with the Court stating that its primary inmate witness, &#34;inmate #1&#34;,
					had not been promised any benefit, and in fact, he had not even asked for any benefit.</p>

				<p>(3) On October 18, 2013, because of the extraordinary amount of media coverage of the trial, Judge Pullan ordered the Utah County Attorney to instruct all of its witnesses
					to not watch the trial on television.</p>

				<p>(4) On November 9, 2013, after a 5 week trial, costing tax payers a substantial amount of money, the jury returned a GUILTY verdict.</p>

				<p>(5) On November 15, 2013, the Utah County Attorney's Office wrote a letter to &#34;inmate #1's&#34; federal prosecutor stating that &#34;inmate #1&#34; was a &#34;very important&#34;
					witness at the trial resulting in conviction of MacNeill, and highly recommending leniency for him.</p>

				<p>(6) On December 4, 2013, the Federal Judge in Tennessee, the district where &#34;inmate #1&#34; is from, signed an order eliminating the final 25 1/2 months of &#34;inmate
					#1's&#34; sentence because of his substantial government assistance in the MacNeill case.</p>

				<p>(7) Also in December of 2013, the defense attorney obtained recorded phone calls from September of 2013 documenting &#34;inmate #1's&#34; telephone conversations with the
					Utah County Attorney's Office investigator, his family, and others. Those phone calls confirm that in September of 2013, inmate #1 had asked the Utah County Attorney's
					Office to provide him with the substantial government assistance letter, and the county attorney's office agreed to write it. (This was nearly two weeks before Judge Pullan's
					10/8/13 letter, and three weeks before the county's 10/15/13 court filing declaring that &#34;inmate #1&#34; had not asked for any benefit, and the county had not promised
					to do anything for him).</p>

				<p>(8) Inmate #1's recorded telephone calls from prison also revealed that he had been watching parts of the trial on television.</p>

				<p>(9) On December 27, 2013, MacNeill's criminal defense attorney filed a motion to over-turn the jury verdict because the Utah County Attorney's Office had violated the Court's
					order to disclose all benefits &#34;promised, expressed, or implied,&#34; and the court order to inform all of its witnesses to not watch the trial.</p>

				<p>(10) On January 29, 2014, a Utah County Attorney's Office investigator signed an affidavit admitting that on September 27, 2013, at &#34;inmate #1's&#34; request, he spoke
					to the inmate's attorney, and was asked to write the substantial government assistance letter for the inmate in exchange for the inmate's willingness to testify. The affidavit
					also admitted that the inmate was not advised of the judge's order to refrain from watching the trial on television until more than a week after the trial started when
					the inmate was transferred to Utah.</p>

				<p>What a travesty of justice it will be to the family of Michele MacNeill if the conviction they have sought for and waited on for nearly seven years now, is overturned because
					our Utah County Attorney's Office failed to follow clear and unambiguous orders issued by the judge. This conduct is preventable. It should never happen.</p>

				<p>If you entrust me to be your next Utah County Attorney, I commit to you that I will strive with all of the energy I possess to teach and demand of myself and all attorneys
					in the office, the highest degree of moral and ethical conduct, and not put hard fought murder convictions at risk due to questionable conduct of the prosecution.</p>
