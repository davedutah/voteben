				<p>Dear Friends and Voters,</p>

				<p>As we have been presenting evidence on the need for change in our Utah County Attorney's Office, I have listed a number of specific criminal cases and investigations and discussed their details in debates and speeches around the County. We will continue to tell you about those cases and others, as well as the concerns they reveal about our current County Attorney Office.</p>

				<p>But we have also seen issues with the way the Administration and the civil side of the office operate. This morning we were sent <a href="http://financialreports.utah.gov/saoreports/2013/13-EAGL-8LbUtahCountyUtahCounty.pdf" target="_blank">a report from the State Auditor's Office</a> that concluded a County contract -- approved by the Utah County Attorney's office and providing funds for the commission of a Pony Express statue in Eagle Mountain -- had deficiencies. The State Auditors found that basic protections and obvious terms that could have and should have been included in that contract were neglected or omitted. As a consequence, the County and the taxpayers had no assurance that work would ever be completed, and the financial investment was not protected the way that it needs to be.</p>

				<p>We ask for your support.</p>

				<p>Yours Truly,
					<br />
					Ben Stanley
