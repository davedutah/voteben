			<p>Dear Voters:</p>

			<p>Tim Taylor, the chief deputy for my opponent, Jeff Buhman, was the lead attorney involved in the Mortensen grand jury proceedings wherein a substantial amount of inaccurate information was presented to the grand jury leading to their indictment. Most of the inaccurate information was demonstrably untrue based on police reports in Mr. Taylor’s possession. This type of prosecutorial misconduct is unacceptable in the Utah County Attorney’s Office. A copy of the <a href="http://voteben.com/media/Mortensen%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">Mortensen civil complaint</a> highlights again with documentary evidence the distortions and misrepresentations of an office in need of improvement.
			</p><p>
			I urge voters to read that <a href="http://voteben.com/media/Mortensen%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">complaint</a>, and in particular study the exact quotes and exhibits contained therein. The information I have disseminated to you has been based on records in the possession of the Utah County Attorney’s Office and declarations of local judges. 
			</p><p>
			Rather than accept anyone’s words at face value, I invite you to review the records from the <a href="http://voteben.com/media/Mortensen%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">Mortensen case</a>, the <a href="http://www.voteben.com/media/Reply%20Memo%20in%20Support%20of%20Motion%20to%20Arrest%20Judgment.pdf" target="_blank">MacNeill case</a>, the <a href="http://voteben.com/media/Paul%20Pratt%20Dismissal%20Order%20for%20Failure%20to%20C.pdf" target="_blank">Pratt case</a>, the <a href="http://voteben.com/missutah.html" target="_blank">Craig case</a>, and the <a href="http://financialreports.utah.gov/saoreports/2013/13-EAGL-8LbUtahCountyUtahCounty.pdf" target="_blank">State Auditor’s report</a>. I could have submitted many more examples, but have refrained because the above cases illustrate why I would like to help bring about change for the better for Utah County by serving as the Utah County Attorney.
			</p><p>
			I have passed the bar exam and become licensed in three different states: Illinois, California, and Utah. In each state I joined the bar by examination, proving over multiple days of testing each time my mastery of criminal law, criminal procedure, rules of evidence, constitutional law, and topics like property, torts, ethics, corporations, and law unique to each jurisdiction. I started practicing law in 2003 for one of the largest firms in the world, and gained substantial experience in both the civil and criminal justice system. It is true that I have not previously been a prosecutor. I see that as an asset. I have the skills to evaluate both the legal issues as well as administrative needs, and take the Utah County Attorney’s Office to the level of accountability, transparency, and integrity where it should be operating. I can bring an outside and private sector perspective that has been sorely lacking.
			</p><p>
			Recently, Governor Herbert appointed Sean Reyes, a very smart and good attorney, without any prior prosecution experience, to lead the largest prosecutor’s office in the state—the Attorney General’s Office. Like Mr. Reyes, I am confident that I have the skills and ability to effectively lead and serve as your next Utah County Attorney, and I humbly request your vote.
