<p class="text">A grandson of Orem farmers and educators, with a father in the United States Air Force who kept him traveling the world during his youth, Ben is proud to call Utah County home. Following undergraduate degrees in philosophy, psychology, and logic, Ben went on to graduate <em>magna cum laude</em> and Order of the Coif from the J. Reuben Clark Law School (BYU) in Provo, where he served on the executive boards of the Law Review and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Society, and developed web-based and computer-automated legal tools used throughout Utah County. He practiced intellectual property, securities, and corporate governance law, handling billion-dollar litigation for global industry leaders and public companies at the top law firm of Chicago and later California, and defending officers and directors of public companies accused of criminal misconduct.</p>

<p class="text">He returned to Utah with his beautiful wife of fourteen years, Rebekah, who he married in the Mount Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, to raise their three small children in an inspiring community that they have always loved. A gifted chemist and dedicated mother, Rebekah has played violin with the Pleasant Grove Orchestra for the past five years and can often be found visiting friends and serving tirelessly in the community. Ben serves on the City Council of Pleasant Grove, its library board, arts commission, graduated from the citizen police academy, and is active in its Rotary Club.</p>

<p class="text">Ben drafted policy positions, ranging from water rights, prison reform, tort reform, constitutional reform, tax policy, and job creation legislation for a leading candidate for Governor of California during that stateâ€™s 2010 election cycle, undertook election law compliance research for the Romney presidential campaigns, and currently provides legal advice to technology companies in Utah and elsewhere on avoiding and favorably resolving disputes as the head of litigation at <a href="http://techlawventures.com/" class="bodyTextLink" target="_blank">TechLaw Ventures, PLLC</a>, in Lehi.</p>
