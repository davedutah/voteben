<p class="text">Ben's support across Utah County comes from his simple and sincere message that government should serve the people. He is that rare figure who means what he says and fights for it in office despite political and other pressures to do differently, bringing unmatched private sector experience and judgment to occasional public positions. He has extended family all across the valley, and wants a County Attorney who will win the cases the office brings, and bring only those cases that have merit. He will protect his family and yours by consistently pursuing five things:</p>

<p class="subheader">1.  Accountability</p>

<p class="text">Violent offenders and fraudsters must be held accountable, and will be relentlessly investigated and pursued. But prosecutors, government employees, and elected officials too must be held accountable to their promises, to their stewardships of taxpayer money, and to their levels of performance. Ben empowers those he serves, and fosters environments of professionalism and sound discretion, but will not tolerate corruption or misconduct in the Utah County Attorney's office and broader criminal justice system.</p>

<p class="subheader">2.  Transparency</p>

<p class="text">With Ben Stanley as Utah County Attorney, the office's website will not have a blank media page and news ticker that is only updated every few years. You will know how the office is performing, with data-driven statistical analyses made available to the public, exploring recidivism rates, win/loss ratios, and percentages of pleas in abeyance and diversions. Ben will allow the public, the Innocence Project, and the Center for Prosecutor Integrity to examine cases and express concerns. He will be personally available to answer questions and explain the decisions of the office.</p>

<p class="subheader">3.  Integrity</p>

<p class="text">As Ben has met with other County Attorneys and high profile elected officials, he has constantly advanced the view that decisions in our criminal justice system have profound human impacts: in the lives of victims, the accused, their families, and broader communities. He insists upon a principled, thoughtful approach to every decision, and will raise the standards of our government employees. What will those standards be? Constitutional Standards. Ben enjoys the support of those who know him best because they know he will be consistent and willing to do the right things for the right reasons.</p>

<p class="subheader">4.  Capability</p>

<p class="text">Ben believes in bringing the highest levels of private and public sector experience together, to address the criminal and civil responsibilities of the Utah County Attorney's Office with the greatest academic and career qualifications available, and wants our County to have the caliber of attorneys we deserve. He will empower and entrust our most accomplished prosecutors who command great respect in the community and who exercise their discretion with wisdom, and he will recruit the most talented from the private sector to contribute in meaningful ways with recommendations, improvement, and volunteer opportunities to be involved in the criminal justice system.</p>

<p class="subheader">5.  Efficiency</p>

<p class="text">Finally, Ben envisions an active, effective, professional office that recognizes the service provided to the community and insists upon judicious use of public resources while maximizing benefits to the people of our County. He lives in the details and the numbers, and will undertake a number of important analyses of the performance of the office, exploring options to strengthen results, retain talent, outsource where appropriate, synergize, and discover new avenues to enhance the demonstrable returns for the taxpayers. Too often that office has lost cases that it should not have lost and brought cases it should not have brought.</p>
